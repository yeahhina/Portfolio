# Yeasmin Mumtahina. - Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built with React and deployed online to showcase my projects, skills, and experience.  


## Features

- A landing page with project cards for quick browsing.  
- Individual project detail pages generated from Markdown files using "React-Markdown".  

## Technologies Used

- React – for building the website structure and components.  
- React-Markdown – to render Markdown content as project detail pages.  
- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS – for functionality, layout, and styling.  

## User Interface

The user interface was first designed in Figma with a retro lilac theme that reflects my personal style.

The navigation layout was designed to be simple and smooth, making it easy for visitors to browse through projects, skills, and other sections of the site.

The following is a screenshot of the figma design:
