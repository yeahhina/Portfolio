# Heiwa

For my A-Level project, I created a Python application called “Heiwa – Wellbeing Planner”. It’s a planner tool with an additional mini-game feature, designed to motivate users and help them avoid procrastination.

This was my first computer science project, and it came with plenty of challenges. The application had issues such as a cluttered navigation layout, large blocks of code, and a less polished user interface. Despite these flaws, it was an invaluable learning experience that helped me understand software design, coding practices, and user experience.

## Project Objectives

I created a system where users could organize tasks and interact with a virtual pet. The more they engaged with the planner, the more rewards they earned through pet interactions and a mini-game.

The main objectives of the application were:

- Implement a login system for users.
- Provide a calendar to visualize tasks, events, or activities.
- Allow users to create and delete tasks, events, or activities.
- Enable interaction with the virtual pet to motivate engagement.
- Include a Sudoku mini-game as an additional feature to encourage regular use.

## Technologies Used

- Python – used as the main programming language to implement the application logic, handle user input, and manage interactions.
- Tkinter – Python’s GUI toolkit, used to create the graphical interface, including windows, buttons, calendars, and forms.
- MySQL – used to store user data, tasks, events, and pet progress persistently.

## User Interface

Again, this was my first project. I had no experience of UI but I still wanted to make something I was proud of. At the time, I was. Now, not that much anymore.
