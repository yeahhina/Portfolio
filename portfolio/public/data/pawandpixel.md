# Paw And Pixel

As part of the module, "Database Application Development" at Kingston University, we were asked to develop a web application for "Paws And Pixels", a retro gaming business that allows user to book and rent a selection of vintage computers and consoles.

## Project Objectives

As a developer, I was responsible for implementing a web application that allows users and staff to interact efficiently with games and machines. Key features included:

- Allowing visitors to search for games and see which machines each game runs on.
- Enabling users to search for machines and check their availability.
- Providing clients with an easy way to reserve a machine.
- Allowing staff members to add and update games and machines.

The project was focused on functionality, rather than UI. However, there were certain aspects that we were assessed on:

- Consider appropriate accessibility factors
- Provide a responsive user experience
- Consider relevant security factors, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting

## Technologies Used

- PHPMyAdmin for managing and storing data.
- PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for building the web application.
